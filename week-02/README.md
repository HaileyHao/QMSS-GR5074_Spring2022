### Complementary Resources

#### Google Colaboratory

If you've worked with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org), you're probably very familiar with the basics of the workflow in [**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com) (aka **Colab**). We will be using this tool heavily, so spend some time getting familiar with it through these resources:
* [Colab feature review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNgswRZ2C1Y) video
* [Getting Started](https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=GJBs_flRovLc) (a gateway for multiple resources therein)
* [Overview of Colab features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)
* [Using Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/main/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)
* [More resources](https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=-Rh3-Vt9Nev9)

Remember to sign in with your Columbia email to get all the benefits available to us.


#### AI Model Share Initiative

Take some time to familiarize yourself with the AI Model Share platform. We will also use this tool heavily since all our internal competitions and model learning will happen there. In particular, start playing around with the [**starter code notebooks**](https://www.modelshare.org/search/deploy) to deploy model playgrounds and competitions.
